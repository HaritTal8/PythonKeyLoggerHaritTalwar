# PythonKeyLoggerHaritTalwar
A simple keylogger created using python. My program tracks any activities represented on a given keyboard and represents the output in the text editor's terminal.
My initial idea for the program was to register 25 keys typed into a new .txt file. However, the output of the program represents the keys typed being tracked on the terminal of the text editor (atom).
